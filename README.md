# ihsm

An _idiomatic_ hierarchical state machine implementation library for Typescript and Javascript.

It has been designed to _feel as "natural"_  as possible to any TS/JS developer. 

_Easy to learn, hard to master_ 

It's fully featured as it supports the full _UML currentState chart_ formalism, but it's so easy and natural to write that 
its actually faster to define a state machine using code rather then diagrams.

It supports:   
   * Extended events (user defined event payload)
   * Extended states (user defined state variables)
   * Hierarchically nested states
   * Orthogonal states
   * Actions
   * Internal transitions
   * Transitions
   * Transition to history
   * Guards
   * Entry/Exit actions
   * async/sync function on entry, exit and all event handlers
